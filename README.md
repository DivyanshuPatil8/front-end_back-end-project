💡 Why This Project is Useful
Helps beginners understand how CRUD operations work in a real web app

Demonstrates how to connect a Java backend to a PostgreSQL database

Shows how to use Thymeleaf for dynamic HTML rendering

Provides hands-on experience in full-stack development and deployment

Can be extended into a more advanced project (e.g., add authentication, REST API)

🌐 Live Deployment
This application is hosted on Render, which makes it accessible online for testing or demonstration. 
It serves as a solid foundation for more complex enterprise-level or full-stack applications.
